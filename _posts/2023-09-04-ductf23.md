# Eight Five Four Five
*Disclaimer: This is the first blockchain challenge I have done, so the technical aspects about smart contracts for this writeup can be inaccurate.*

The contract for this challenge is written in *Solidity*

This is a beginner blockchain challenge that is supposed to just learn players how to interact with smart contracts.
For this I used the python-library [Web3](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Before we are able to interact with the smartcontract we need to get the [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html) of the smart contract, which is the standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem. Once we have the ABI of the contract we are able to call functions defined in the given contract. `compile.py` compiles the challenge-provided smart contract `EightFiveFourFive.sol` with [solcx](https://github.com/ApeWorX/py-solc-x) to give us the ABI for the contract.

```python
import solcx

#solcx.install_solc("0.8.19")
temp_file = solcx.compile_files(
    'EightFiveFourFive.sol',
    output_values=['abi'],
    solc_version='0.8.19'
)
abi = temp_file['EightFiveFourFive.sol:EightFiveFourFive']['abi']
```
{: file=compile.py}


Looking at the smart contract we are given we can see three functions that we are able to call
```
function readTheStringHere() external view returns (string memory) {
    return use_this;
}

function solve_the_challenge(string memory answer) external {
    you_solved_it = keccak256(bytes(answer)) == keccak256(bytes(use_this));
}

function isSolved() external view returns (bool) {
    return you_solved_it;
}
```
{: .nolineno }

The contract also use two variables, where one is *private* and one is *public*.
```
string private use_this;
bool public you_solved_it = false;
```
{: .nolineno }

To solve the challenge we need to change the `you_solved_it` variable to true, which can be done by reading the private variable `use_this` through calling the `readTheStringHere` function, and calling the function `solve_the_challenge` with the value of `use_this` as an argument. The `solve_the_challenge` changes `you_solved_it` to **True** if the two keccak256 hashes match, e.g. our argument passed to the function must match with the private variable.


Our smart contract instance gives us the RPC-url, Contract address, Private key, and Wallet address needed to create a *connection* to the contract.
```python
rpc_url = "<rpc_url>"
contract_address = '<contract_addr>'
private_key = "<pk>"
wallet_address = "<wallet_addr>"

# Create web3 connection
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(rpc_url))
```
{: .nolineno }

We also need to create an *instance* of the contract, which we will use to call its functions. With this we can obtain the secret value we need to get the flag (the secret value is `I can connect to the blockchain!`).
```python
# Create contract instance and get the secret by calling readTheStringHere()
contract = web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)
secret = contract.functions.readTheStringHere().call()
```
{: .nolineno }

Once we have the secret value we can call the `solve_the_challenge` function, however this is not as easy to do as when we called `readTheStringHere`.

To call the `solve_the_challenge` function with the secret as the argument we need to build and create a transaction. For that we need a *nonce*, which can be obtained with the web3 function `get_transaction_count` (the nonce is a value which indicates the transaction count from a wallet address). We also need a *gasPrice*, which in short terms is the price for executing a function. We can just set this to 1 and let web3 handle the rest. We also set the *chainId* parameter to the value given to us from the launched challenge instance.
```python
nonce = web3.eth.get_transaction_count(wallet_address)
tx = {
    "nonce": nonce,
    'gasPrice': web3.to_wei('1', 'gwei'),
    'chainId': 31337
}
```
{: .nolineno }

Finally we can create the transaction for calling `solve_the_challenge(secret)` by building the transaction, sign it using our given private key, and sending the transaction to the smart contract server.
```python
# Create, sign and send transaction
txn_data = contract.functions.solve_the_challenge(secret).build_transaction(tx)
signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(txn_data, private_key=private_key)
web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
```
{: .nolineno }

The full script is provided below
```python
import requests
from compile import abi
from web3 import Web3

rpc_url = "<rpc_url>"
contract_address = '<contract_addr>'
private_key = "<pk>"
wallet_address = "<wallet_addr>"

# Create web3 connection
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(rpc_url))

# Create contract instance and get the secret by calling readTheStringHere()
contract = web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)
secret = contract.functions.readTheStringHere().call()

# Setup required fields for transaction
nonce = web3.eth.get_transaction_count(wallet_address)
tx = {
    "nonce": nonce,
    'gasPrice': web3.to_wei('1', 'gwei'),
    'chainId': 31337
}

# Create, sign and send transaction
txn_data = contract.functions.solve_the_challenge(secret).build_transaction(tx)
signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(txn_data, private_key=private_key)
web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
```
{: file=solve.py }

Running the script allows us to get the flag through the frontend we are given for the contract.
